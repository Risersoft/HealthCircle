## Transformations

**Transform Before** -> Transform before worked before view output generated.

![](/images/TransformBeforeweb.png)

**< MAINGRID >** is starting tag and **< /MainGrid>** is ending tag.

**SCROSS** -> Type of transformation. 
 
**TARGET** -> we can set index of defined complex views in view in this tag if complex view is not define then we can set 0 for this tag.

**IDFIELD**->Assigned key field. Like Returnperiod

**PIVOT**->Assigned field to transform as header. Like SectionName

**AGGCOL**->Assigned field to transform below header respective SectionName. Like Amount

**ADDCOL** ->Column name which is to be added.

**KEY**->Assigned Caption name for added Field like perInc

**FORMULA**->Set value for Added column.

## Type of Transformations

2.1. **SCROSS:** For defining Scross we can used below xml tags.

![](/images/commontabweb.png)

**< MAINGRID> < /MAINGRID>** ->  < MainGrid> is starting tag and < /MainGrid> is ending tag.

**< SCROSS> < /SCROSS>** ->  < SCROSS> is starting tag and < /SCROSS> is ending tag.
 
**TARGET** -> We can set index of defined complex views in view in this tag if complex view is not define then we can set 0 for this tag.

**PIVOT** -> Assigned field to transform as header. Like Descrip

**IDFIELD** -> We can set unique key field for idfield. Like EmployeeID

**AGGCOL** -> We can set field to transform below header respective assigned column in pivot like Descrip. i.e Dated

2.2. **COCROSS:**

![](/images/Cocrossweb.jpg)

**< MAINGRID >  < /MAINGRID >** ->  < MainGrid > is starting tag and < /MainGrid > is ending tag.

**< COCROSS >  < /COCROSS >** ->  <COCROSS> is starting tag and </COCROSS>  is ending tag.

**IDFIELD** ->  We can set unique key field for idfield. Like EmployeeID

**COPYDT** -> we can set 0 in this tag

**PIVOT** -> Assigned field to transform as header. Like MaterialDept

**AGGCOL** -> We can set field to transform below header respective assigned column in pivot like MaterialDept. i.e IncentiveAmount

**VIEW INDEX** -> we can set 0, 1, 2 in this tag

**PREFIX** -> we can set text for display as prefix.

**< ATTRIBUTIZE >  < /ATTRIBUTIZE >** -> < ATTRIBUTIZE > is starting tag and < / ATTRIBUTIZE >  is ending tag.

**TARGET** -> we can set index of defined complex views in view in this tag if complex view is not define then we can set 0 for this tag.

**PIVOT** -> Set starting fixed latterâ€™s of columns to transform as header and respective values are showing below of respective columns. Like Attrib1Name, Attrib1Value, Attrib2Name, Attrib2Value, Attrib3Name, Attrib3Value.

**VALUE VALUE1** -> Assigned values for applied filter key.

**</FILTER KEY>** -> Ending tag of filter key.

**< OVERRIDE>** -> Starting Tag  **</ OVERRIDE>**-> Ending tag 

**< MMRXML>** -> Starting Tag **< /MMRXML>** -> Ending tag

**< STRVIEW> < /STRVIEW>** -> we can set display name for view between these tags.

**< MMR>** ->Starting Tag and **< MMR>** ->Ending Tag

**HEADER PREFIX** -> Set Header of MMR output.
